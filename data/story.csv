"Once upon a time,",there was a headstrong light fairy named Elle who lived in a little boy's bedroom.
"And every day,",Elle would leave her light to help the little boy find the light switch.
"Until one day,",a thunderstorm caused a power outage which made all the lights go out and scared the little boy.
"And because of that,","Elle tried to go to the boy and light up in front of him, but wasn't able to keep her light on for long."
"And because of that,",the other light fairies in the room came to Elle's aid and lit up together.
"Until finally,",they were able to produce a light that was bright enough to comfort the boy.
"And ever since that day,",Elle and the other fairies lived together in harmony.
